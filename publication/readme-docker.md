I created a docker image with PHP/Apache with the published
IG files that can be viewed locally.

To be able to see the locally built published IG, edit the `/etc/hosts` file 
and add following line (MacOS or Linux/Unix). See note above re HSTS and browsers.
```
127.0.0.1    fhir.nmdp.org
```

Now, when my browser tries to go to example.org, it gets routed to my localhost.
Remember, you'll have to comment it out before you can see the real fhir.nmdp.org site.

Create a docker image (see the Dockerfile) by running the following commands.

First see if a previous container is running, and stop it if it is.
```
$ docker container ls
CONTAINER ID   IMAGE         COMMAND                  CREATED       STATUS       PORTS                NAMES
fd767ed9d25c   myig:latest   "docker-php-entrypoi…"   3 hours ago   Up 3 hours   0.0.0.0:80->80/tcp   agitated_torvalds

$ docker stop agitated_torvalds
```

Now build and run the new docker image.
```
$ docker build -t myig:latest .
$ docker run -d -p 80:80 myig:latest
```

Point the browser to `http://fhir.nmdp.org/ig/matchsync`
